**RAG Service**

The RAG Service is used by our Q&A chatbot interface to provide ChatGPT with the usersâ€™ questions and the relevant lecture documents in order for it to synthesize an answer that is contextually relevant and based on the course material.
To improve system response times, we cache the responses generated by ChatGPT. This means that if the same question is asked again, the system can retrieve the answer from the in-memory cache.
